# TransSent - Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews using Transformers and Fine-Tuning.
- This project is a text classification model that uses Transformers to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in movie reviews.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify movie reviews into their respective sentiment categories. This will be achieved by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model on the Large Movie Review Dataset.

## Dataset
The Large Movie Review Dataset, also known as the IMDb dataset, contains 50,000 movie reviews for training and testing. It is available at the following link: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/.
